/-! `Pg.Rel` — what a query MEANS, so that "this plan equals that plan" can be
said at all.

WHAT THIS REPO HAS TODAY: an AST, a catalog, a type system, a PL/pgSQL
surface, an IR of datums and comparisons, and `Query/Top.lean` — which is
top-level DDL statements (CREATE SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, ALTER
TABLE), not relational algebra. There is no plan node, no cost, no join, and —
the thing that actually blocks everything — NO DENOTATION. Nothing says what a
query MEANS. Until something does, "this plan equals that plan" is not a
statement that can be made, let alone proved.

So this is denotation first, and it deliberately walks into the three places a
naive model gives FALSE theorems:

  BAGS, NOT SETS      SQL keeps duplicates. A model over sets proves
                      `union_idempotent`, which is true of sets and false of
                      SQL, and every rewrite built on it is wrong.
  THREE-VALUED LOGIC  a predicate is true, false, or UNKNOWN, and `WHERE` keeps
                      only TRUE. This is where the interesting bugs live.
  ⛔ SO PREDICATES DO NOT PARTITION. `filter p` and `filter (not p)` do not
                      reassemble the table when a NULL is present — which
                      is the habit every engineer brings from a language whose
                      predicates are BOOLEAN. Carried into SQL it becomes an
                      optimisation that silently drops every row with a null in
                      the compared column.

/-- Whether two rows join, on equality of their first column.

⛔ NULL DOES NOT JOIN TO NULL. `a.x = b.x` is UNKNOWN when either is null, and a
join keeps only TRUE — so two rows that are both null on the key do NOT match.

anything to pad. -/

/- ── The trap ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -/

/-- **A predicate and its negation do not reassemble the table.**

⛔ THE THEOREM THAT MUST BE STATED BEFORE ANY REWRITE IS BUILT. "Filter by a
predicate and by its complement and you have the whole back" is true of BOOLEAN
predicates and is the intuition everyone arrives with.

SQL predicates are not boolean. A row whose predicate is UNKNOWN is kept by
neither side, so the two halves are missing it. A planner that carries the
partition habit across writes an optimisation that silently drops every row
with a null in the compared column — which is the most common shape of
production data there is.

The witness is one row and one null. -/
theorem a_predicate_does_not_partition :
    ∃ (db : String → Table) (p : Pred) (t : String),
      denote db (.union (.filter p (.scan t)) (.filter (.not p) (.scan t)))
        ≠ denote db (.scan t) := by
  refine ⟨fun _ => [[Val.null]], .eqNum 0 1, "t", ?_⟩
  simp [denote, evalPred, cell]

/-- What IS true, and all that is: **filtering never invents a row.**

So a planner may use a predicate to PRUNE and never to REASSEMBLE. The
distinction is the whole practical content of the theorem above. -/

    (denote db (.filter p (.scan t))).length ≤ (db t).length := by
  simp only [denote]
  exact List.length_filter_le _ _

/-- **And no row is kept by both halves**, which is why the loss above is
silent: nothing double-counts to hide it. A row is kept by `p` or by `not p` or
by NEITHER, and the third case has no symptom at all. -/

  simp [evalPred, h1] at h2

/-- Every row a left row produces carries that left row as its prefix, so a
predicate that reads only the prefix decides the whole group at once.

This is why pushing into the PRESERVED side is sound and pushing into the other
one is not: one predicate sees the same values before and after the join, and
the other sees nulls that did not exist before it. -/

/- ── The classic planner bug ───────────────────────────────────────────── -/

/-- **A predicate on the null-padded side CANNOT be pushed below an outer
join.**

⛔ THE BUG THIS FILE WAS BUILT TO CATCH, and the one every real planner has had.

    SELECT * FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON a.k = b.k WHERE b.v = 5

Pushing `b.v = 5` into the scan of `b` looks obviously sound — it is a
restriction on `b`, and `b` is right there. It is not sound, and the two differ
on the rows of `a` THAT MATCH NOTHING:

  * filtering ABOVE the join sees those rows already padded with nulls, so
    `b.v = 5` is UNKNOWN and they are dropped;
  * filtering BELOW the join shrinks `b` first, so those rows still match
    nothing and come back PADDED and kept.

One keeps them, the other does not. The witness needs only a left row with no
partner. -/
theorem pushdown_below_an_outer_join_is_unsound :
    ∃ (db : String → Table) (p : Pred) (a b : String) (w : Nat),
      denote db (.filter p (.leftJoin (.scan a) (.scan b) w))
        ≠ denote db (.leftJoin (.scan a) (.filter p (.scan b)) w) := by
  refine ⟨fun t => if t = "a" then [[Val.num 1]] else [], .eqNum 1 5, "a", "b", 1, ?_⟩
  simp [denote, evalPred, cell]

/-- **What IS sound: a predicate on the PRESERVED side.**

The mirror of the theorem above, and the rewrite a planner actually wants. A
restriction that reads only the left row commutes with the join, because
dropping that row before or after deciding what it matched gives the same rows
either way.

`hp` is the side condition and it is the whole distinction: the predicate must
see the same values before and after the join. A predicate on the right side
does not — after the join it can see nulls that did not exist before it, which
is exactly `pushdown_below_an_outer_join_is_unsound`.

The proof is one step per left row: `everyRowKeepsItsLeft` decides that row's
whole group at once, and the induction carries the rest. -/
