/-! `Pg.Rel` — what a query MEANS, so that "this plan equals that plan" can be
said at all.

WHAT THIS REPO HAS TODAY: an AST, a catalog, a type system, a PL/pgSQL
surface, an IR of datums and comparisons, and `Query/Top.lean` — which is
top-level DDL statements (CREATE SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, ALTER
TABLE), not relational algebra. There is no plan node, no cost, no join, and —
the thing that actually blocks everything — NO DENOTATION. Nothing says what a
query MEANS. Until something does, "this plan equals that plan" is not a
statement that can be made, let alone proved.

So this is denotation first, and it deliberately walks into the three places a
naive model gives FALSE theorems:

  BAGS, NOT SETS      SQL keeps duplicates. A model over sets proves
                      `union_idempotent`, which is true of sets and false of
                      SQL, and every rewrite built on it is wrong.
  THREE-VALUED LOGIC  a predicate is true, false, or UNKNOWN, and `WHERE` keeps
                      only TRUE. This is where the interesting bugs live.
  ⛔ SO PREDICATES DO NOT PARTITION. `filter p` and `filter (not p)` do not
                      reassemble the table when a NULL is present — which
                      is the habit every engineer brings from a language whose
                      predicates are BOOLEAN. Carried into SQL it becomes an
                      optimisation that silently drops every row with a null in
                      the compared column.

/- ── The trap ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -/

/-- **A predicate and its negation do not reassemble the table.**

⛔ THE THEOREM THAT MUST BE STATED BEFORE ANY REWRITE IS BUILT. "Filter by a
predicate and by its complement and you have the whole back" is true of BOOLEAN
predicates and is the intuition everyone arrives with.

SQL predicates are not boolean. A row whose predicate is UNKNOWN is kept by
neither side, so the two halves are missing it. A planner that carries the
partition habit across writes an optimisation that silently drops every row
with a null in the compared column — which is the most common shape of
production data there is.

The witness is one row and one null. -/
theorem a_predicate_does_not_partition :
    ∃ (db : String → Table) (p : Pred) (t : String),
      denote db (.union (.filter p (.scan t)) (.filter (.not p) (.scan t)))
        ≠ denote db (.scan t) := by
  refine ⟨fun _ => [[Val.null]], .eqNum 0 1, "t", ?_⟩
  simp [denote, evalPred, cell]

/-- What IS true, and all that is: **filtering never invents a row.**

So a planner may use a predicate to PRUNE and never to REASSEMBLE. The
distinction is the whole practical content of the theorem above. -/

  exact List.length_filter_le _ _

/-- **And no row is kept by both halves**, which is why the loss above is
silent: nothing double-counts to hide it. A row is kept by `p` or by `not p` or
by NEITHER, and the third case has no symptom at all. -/
